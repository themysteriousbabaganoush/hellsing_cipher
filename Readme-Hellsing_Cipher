## 📦 Hellsing Academy – Tech Division Cypher v11 🛡️

> *Encrypt like a vampire, decrypt like a gentleman.*

Welcome to the official **HellsingCipher Encryption Suite v11**:
A totally overkill, borderline‑paranoid, AES‑powered encryption tool that makes your secrets vanish like a ninja in the night.

**Written in Python** with a sprinkle of ☕ coffee‑fueled paranoia, it lets you:

* Encrypt & decrypt text messages, single files, or entire folders
* Shred originals like yesterday’s embarrassing selfies
* Log every glorious move (in your own local logs)

---

## 🐧 Windows? Linux? Mac?

Yes! (Mostly)

You can either:

* Run the raw Python file (`hellsingcipher.py`) if you have Python installed
* Or run the standalone executable (if you compiled it) – no Python needed!

---

## 🛠 How to build & run

### 1) Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/themysteriousbabaganoush/hellsing_cipher.git
cd HellsingCipher
```

---

### 2) Install Dependencies

If you choose to run the raw Python file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install them:

```
pycryptodome
tqdm
```

---

### 3) Run like the wind

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
python3 hellsingcipher.py
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
python hellsingcipher.py
```

Or simply run the compiled `hellsingcipher.exe` (if you made one).

---

## 🧰 How to Compile to EXE (Windows) or Binary (Linux)

Optional, but makes you feel cooler:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile hellsingcipher.py
```

You’ll get an executable in the `dist` folder.
Perfect for carrying on your USB stick marked "Definitely Not Hacking Tools".

## ⚙️ Usage – The Menu of Doom

Once you run it, you'll see glorious ASCII art and a menu:

```
1) Encrypt Message
2) Decrypt Message
3) Encrypt File
4) Decrypt File
5) Encrypt Folder
6) Decrypt Folder
7) Exit
```

* **Encrypt**: Enter your password twice (don’t forget it — Dracula won’t help recover it).
* **Decrypt**: Type password once (if you remember it).
* **Shred original**: Choose `y` to overwrite & delete files after encryption.

Logs go into the `log/` folder, timestamped like ancient scrolls.

---

## 🔧 Dependencies (raw Python version):

```
Python >= 3.8
pycryptodome
tqdm
```

You can install them all via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔒 Features

✅ AES‑256‑CBC encryption
✅ PBKDF2 key derivation with 200,000 iterations (brutally slow for attackers)
✅ SHA‑256 file hashing for integrity checks
✅ Shredding originals
✅ Encrypted headers with metadata
✅ Progress bars so you look busy at coffee shops

## 🩸 Final Words
